# Specification Quality Checklist: Futuristic Robotics-Themed UI Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Feature**: [Futuristic Robotics-Themed UI Redesign](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

✅ **SPECIFICATION PASSED ALL QUALITY CHECKS** - Ready for Planning Phase

**Summary**:
- 4 user stories defined with clear priorities (P1-P4)
- 13 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-013)
- 8 measurable success criteria (SC-001 to SC-008)
- 5 edge cases identified
- Clear assumptions, dependencies, and scope boundaries
- All requirements are technology-agnostic and focused on user experience
- Independent testing criteria defined for each user story
