# Tasks: Docusaurus Physical AI Textbook

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-docusaurus-book/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested. Build verification used as validation.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- [X] T002 Install additional dependencies: `@docusaurus/theme-mermaid` and `docusaurus-search-local` via `npm install`
- [X] T003 Configure `docusaurus.config.js` with GitHub Pages settings (url, baseUrl, organizationName, projectName), Mermaid theme, color mode, and `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'`
- [X] T004 Configure `sidebars.js` with autogenerated sidebar from docs directory
- [X] T005 [P] Create custom CSS in `src/css/custom.css` with theme color overrides, RTL placeholder styles, and responsive code block styles
- [X] T006 [P] Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with GitHub Actions workflow for automated GitHub Pages deployment using Node.js 20 and `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
- [X] T007 [P] Create `.gitignore` with Node.js patterns (node_modules/, build/, .docusaurus/, .env*)
- [X] T008 [P] Create stub component `src/components/PersonalizeButton/index.jsx` that renders a disabled button placeholder
- [X] T009 [P] Create stub component `src/components/TranslateButton/index.jsx` that renders a disabled button placeholder
- [X] T010 [P] Create stub component `src/components/ChatWidget/index.jsx` that renders nothing (null) as placeholder

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - BLOCKS all chapter writing
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Phase 2 - provides 1 chapter per module as MVP
- **User Stories 2-5 (Phases 4-7)**: Depend on Phase 2 - can proceed in parallel after Phase 2
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on Phases 4-7 (glossary needs final term list from chapters)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Depends on Phase 2 only. Provides MVP with 1 chapter per module.
- **US2 (P1)**: Depends on Phase 2. Can run in parallel with US3, US4, US5. Chapter 01 already written in US1.
- **US3 (P2)**: Depends on Phase 2. Can run in parallel with US2, US4, US5. Chapter 01 already written in US1.
- **US4 (P2)**: Depends on Phase 2. Can run in parallel with US2, US3, US5. Chapter 01 already written in US1.
- **US5 (P2)**: Depends on Phase 2. Can run in parallel with US2, US3, US4. Chapter 01 already written in US1.
- **US6 (P3)**: Should run after US2-US5 so glossary reflects all terms used in chapters.

### Within Each User Story

- Chapters marked [P] within the same story can be written in parallel
- Verification task must run after all chapter tasks in that story
- Build check required before marking story complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- T005-T010 (Phase 1 setup tasks) can all run in parallel
- T013-T017 (category.json files) can all run in parallel
- All chapter writing tasks across different modules can run in parallel after Phase 2
- T043-T046 (polish verification tasks) can all run in parallel

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T011)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T012-T018)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T023) - 1 chapter per module
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Site builds, navigates, has 4 chapters + intro
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages - **Book is live with MVP content**

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Project skeleton ready
2. US1 → 1 chapter per module → Deploy (MVP!)
3. US2 → Full Module 1 (5 chapters) → Deploy
4. US3 → Full Module 2 (2 chapters) → Deploy
5. US4 → Full Module 3 (3 chapters) → Deploy
6. US5 → Full Module 4 (3 chapters) → Deploy
7. US6 → Appendices (3 pages) → Deploy
8. Polish → Final quality pass → Deploy

## Notes

- Total tasks: 50
- Setup: 11 tasks
- Foundational: 7 tasks
- Chapter writing: 24 tasks (across 6 user stories)
- Polish: 10 tasks (T041-T050 but T041 is not a separate task)
- Parallel opportunities: 30+ tasks can run in parallel when grouped correctly
- Each chapter writing task produces a complete, self-contained MDX file
- Build verification (`npm run build`) is the primary quality gate
